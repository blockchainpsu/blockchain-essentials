## Bitcoin Case Study

A lot of hype has been created by Bitcoin, and of the people that have heard of blockchain, they most likely only know about its implementation in cryptocurrencies.

While Bitcoin has been influential as a driving force to the increase of decentralized applications (DApps) and development in decentralized space, it is hardly the only application of blockchain. However, since Satoshi Nakamoto created the concept, it is worth examining how Bitcoin works.

The **white paper**, or the explanation behind the technical concepts, of Bitcoin can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). However, we also provide a shorter, "tl;dr" version in this repository.
