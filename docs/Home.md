# Welcome to Blockchain Essentials!
*A [Blockchain@PSU](https://blockchainpsu.com) Workshop*

## Description

Blockchain Essentials aims to teach a complete beginner the concepts of blockchain and decentralized development through a practical, interactive mode of instruction.

At the end of the course, you should be able to:

- Understand the concepts underlying blockchain, including hashing, digital signatures and proof-of-work
- Create and work on full-stack projects
- Write smart contracts and use them in decentralized apps (commonly referred to as DApps)
- Work with frameworks designed for DApps, including Truffle and web3

### Prerequisites

This course will often assume that the reader has prior programming experience, but does its best to explain itself conceptually and provide supplemental resources to those who are new to the field, especially coming from a business background.

## Content

In the wiki, you'll find in-depth guides on how to use the workshop material that go far deeper than the regular READMEs in the repository. Each part of the workshop is sectioned into its own category, and the accompanying pages will guide you on what material to especially pay attention to.
