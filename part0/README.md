# Day 0: Introduction

Goals of the day:
 - Understand the workshop structure
 - Learn about version control using Git and GitHub
 - Examine the workings of Bitcoin as an introduction to blockchain

## Syllabus

See the syllabus for an idea of how the course will work, as well as the slide deck in the workshop.

One important thing: while we do use JavaScript in this course to explain different concepts, we won't be spending too much time going over syntax or the nature of JavaScript. If this is your first time programming with JavaScript, we recommend going through a tutorial, such as [NodeSchool's excellent mini-workshops](https://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list) in JavaScript, Git, NodeJS, and much more. 

If this is your first exposure to programming in general, please approach your instructors; they're more than happy to help.

## Version Control

Assuming you've made it this far, you should have a good understanding of how version control works. If you'd like to see a more in-depth tutorial of how to use Git, see GitHub's [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/). You can also download Git to your computer using [their website](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or your respective package manager if you use Linux.

If you'd like to know more about GitHub, check out their ["Hello World"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) guide.

## Bitcoin Case Study

A lot of hype has been created by Bitcoin, and of the people that have heard of blockchain, they most likely only know about its implementation in cryptocurrencies.

While Bitcoin has been influential as a driving force to the increase of decentralized applications (DApps) and development in decentralized space, it is hardly the only application of blockchain. However, since Satoshi Nakamoto created the concept, it is worth examining how Bitcoin works.

The **white paper**, or the explanation behind the technical concepts, of Bitcoin can be found [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). However, we also provide a shorter, "tl;dr" version in this repository.
